Description
-----------

Distributions in numbers of counts for random events at fixed mean counts of approximately 1, 10, and 100 are measured with a scintillation counter exposed to a weak source of gamma rays. The results are compared to the theoretical Poisson distributions for the measured means, and with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of Poisson distributions based on the use of a random number generator on a PC.
